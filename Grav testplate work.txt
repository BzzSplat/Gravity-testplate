COMPLEXE PLANETS/MULTI-PIECE PLANETS:
atmosphere (main collision, things outside an atmosphere experience no gravity)
ground (semi sphere)
possible grav sphere (optimization)
ground objects (stuff on the planet(players, rocks, trees, ailens, ect))

STARS:
bigger planets with different glowing textures and light sources
(low priority) also supernovae or supernovas idk

PLAYER:
some sort of player, just movement and camera is fine for now
(low priority) tool/weapon holding and usage (hl2 weapon selection)
(low priority) item spawn menu (gmod spawn menu but different?)
(low priority) inventory system

(low priority) BUILDING:
placment of machines on planet ground
pipes to connect machines (rope tool from gmod)
materials (energy, metals, gasses, liquids, ect)
machines that do stuff with items

(low priority) SHIP BUILDING:
machines such as grav generators, thrusters, chairs, weapons, FTL drive, ect
no grid based building (bulding stuff like in gmod, maybe alignment tool)

(low priority) ADVANCED PLANETS:
planet temperatures, atmosphere pressure, and gravity based on size
planets contain finite amount of materials in the atmosphere, ground, and maybe lakes
planets change to different type depending on materials in them (more of certain materials means higher chance for specific planet type)
