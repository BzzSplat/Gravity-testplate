Nova main: x * 2.5 (20 = 50)
Nova extra: x * 2 (20 = 40)
Supernovas when stars become blackholes, and possibly when stars collide (only need to add if stars together won't push eachother into blackholes)
Star colors, the larger a star the more blue it is or just random color, could depend on temp AND size later

COMPLEXE PLANETS/MULTI-PIECE PLANETS:
atmosphere (main collision, things outside an atmosphere experience no gravity)
ground (semi sphere)
possible grav sphere (optimization)
ground objects (stuff on the planet(players, rocks, trees, ailens, ect))

STARS:
bigger planets with different glowing textures and light sources
(low priority) also supernovae or supernovas idk

(low priority) ADVANCED PLANETS:
planet temperatures, atmosphere pressure, and gravity based on size
planets contain finite amount of materials in the atmosphere, ground, and maybe lakes
planets change to different type depending on materials in them (more of certain materials means higher chance for specific planet type)

Solutions to moving planets:
-get good and code it
-premake universe simulation and record it, replay the animation and have certain scripts pay at locations for events such as supernovas and blackholes
-
